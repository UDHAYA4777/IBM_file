  Hello! And welcome to this capstone course.
 </p>
 <p>
  Congratulations for making it this far! My name is Joseph Santarcangelo, Yan Luo and Azim Hirjani . We are pleased to be your instructors and course developers for this capstone course. You will apply your data science skills as a Data scientist for a private space launch company in this project.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a starting point of almost all data science projects, you need to collect data, as much and relevant as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be collecting data from various sources. After your raw data has been collected, you will need to improve the quality by performing data wrangling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then you can start exploring the processed data.Â  We will be your guide as we explore some really interesting real-world datasets together. You'll get to practice your SQL skills as we query the data and gather insights.
 </p>
 <p>
  You'll gain further insights into the data by applying some basic statistical analysis and data visualization, you'll be able to see directly how variables might be related to each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  We'll drill down into finer levels of detail by splitting the data into groups defined by categorical variables or factors in your data.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be guided to build, evaluate, and refine predictive models for discovering more exciting insights.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final task of this capstone project is to create a presentation that will be developed into stories of all your analysis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks and good luck!
