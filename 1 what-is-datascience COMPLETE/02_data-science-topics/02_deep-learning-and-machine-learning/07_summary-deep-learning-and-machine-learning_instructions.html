    Deep learning utilizes neural networks to teach itself patterns in inputs and outputs. Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to learn about data and make predictions without explicitly programming the analysis methods into the system.

   <p variant="body1">
    Generative AI, a subset of artificial intelligence, focuses on producing new data rather than just analyzing existing data. It allows machines to create content, including images, music, language, computer code, and more, mimicking creations by people.
