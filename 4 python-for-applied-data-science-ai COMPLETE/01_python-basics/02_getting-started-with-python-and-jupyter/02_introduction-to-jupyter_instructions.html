  Jupyter is a freely available web application that enables creation and sharing of documents containing equations, live coding, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter provides an interactive computing environment that supports multiple programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and more, but it shines brightest when used with Python.  Jupyter revolves around notebooks, documents containing a mix of code, visualizations, narrative text, equations, and multimedia content. These notebooks allow users to create, share, and collaborate on computational projects seamlessly.

   <p variant="body1">
    <strong>
     Rich Output
    </strong>
    : Jupyter Notebooks support rich media integration, allowing users to generate interactive plots, charts, images, videos, and more directly within the document. This makes visualizing data, communicating findings, and creating compelling narratives easier.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    <strong>
     Integration with Data Science Libraries
    </strong>
    : Jupyter seamlessly integrates with popular libraries and frameworks used in the data science ecosystem, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, sci-kit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. This allows users to leverage the full power of these tools within the notebook environment for tasks like data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, and deep learning.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    <strong>
     Collaboration and Sharing
    </strong>
    : Jupyter promotes collaboration and reproducibility by allowing users to share their notebooks with others via email, GitHub, or the Jupyter Notebook Viewer. This facilitates knowledge sharing, peer review, and interdisciplinary collaboration, as users can easily exchange ideas, code snippets, and best practices.
