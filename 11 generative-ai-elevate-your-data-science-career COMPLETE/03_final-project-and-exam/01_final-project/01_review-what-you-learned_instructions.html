    There are four standard generative AI models: Generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), autoregressive, and flow-based models.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li aria-level="1" aria-posinset="2">
   <p variant="body1">
    While GANs are great at data augmentation, VAEs are good at anomaly detection, data compression, collaborative filtering, and style transfer.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li aria-level="1" aria-posinset="3">
   <p variant="body1">
    Autoregressive models are good at text generation, speech synthesis, time series forecasting, and machine translation, and flow-based models are suitable for image and data generation and density estimation.
   </p>
